<h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Digital Fine Art (DFA) </b>seeks to bridge the gap between traditional and digital art, fostering a connection between these two distinct worlds. We facilitate artists in transforming their creations for digital platforms, maintain an exclusive club for art enthusiasts, and are in the process of building an interactive online museum known as the Staking Museum, which offers rewards to art owners. DFA's core belief is in the significance of the digital age for the future of art, and are committed to pioneering this transition.

    DFA empowers artists to adapt their works for the digital realm, creates a community of art lovers through L'Atelier, and establishes a digital gallery for artistic engagement and rewards. Our vision is to not only recognize the inevitability of the digital age's role in art but also to lead the way in embracing and shaping this future.
